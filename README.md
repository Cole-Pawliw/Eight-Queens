# Eight-Queens
A java project exercising recursion with the classic 8 queens puzzle.

The QueensTester.java file is an example file to detail how to use the EightQueens class.
EightQueens can take any board, and if it is possible to place 8 queens so that none of them are attacking each other, it will do so.
